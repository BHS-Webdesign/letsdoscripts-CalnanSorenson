<div class="Gymnastics frame">
  <p>i have been doing gymnastics since I was 3 
years old. Gymnastics is difrent depending on gender,
 female gymnasts there are 4 events wheere as for male 
 gymnasts there are 6 events. For female gymnasts the 4
  events are bars, beam, floor, vault. 
where as for male gymnasts there is floor exercise, 
pommel horse, still rings, vault, parallelbars, 
and horizontial bars. Gymnastics can be a dangrous 
sport for example it can cause tramatic injury
as well as overuse injury.</p> 
<p> As a gymnast I have 
struggled with both. Injury can ruin your career which 
is so hard to think about and it can be a life changing 
thing. I have struggled with tearing my acl, breaking my 
arm, screwing up my ankle, and so much more. Although 
I have been injured before many times I am so beyond 
commited to my sports and gymnastics is what some people 
may call a stress free thing.</p> 
Sometimes I do wonder 
what sport I would have done if I didnt pick gymnastics 
at such a youmng age but for me its not about winning 
but about the feeling you get when you get to 
stand up infront of the judges and give your all
or the feeling of when you get a new skill on an 
event or even the feeling of having such a close bond 
with your teammates. It is truly one big family. 
coaches look for not just skill but the will do 
something and give it your all. one thing that most 
people dont understand is as an older gymnast your 
point of view completely changes. when you younger 
you think dont screw up the big kids are watching 
but when your older it changes to dont screw up the 
little kids are watching. For me it can be 
something to worry about when I know the little kids
are watching but its also the best feeling because 
they make you want to do your best and show them 
that they can achieve things they didnt think they
could. Its also about knowing that they look up to
you. A few weeks ago I sighned up for a job at 
my gym to be a coach, this is because Gymnastics is 
my passion and I want to teach others something 
that has truly got me through everythin I have been 
stuggling without outside. There are for sure some 
very good pros and some very bad cons but getting 
injured is a big part of who you are as a gymnast 
because depending on how hard your working to heal
it proves to your teammates and coah that you really 
want to get somewhere while doing the sport. My favirote
event as a female gymnast would have to for sure be bars or 
floor. The reasoning for my answert is for bars it brings 
me so much joy and it is so fun to do back hip circles. for thos 
who dont know what that is it is where you are in front support 
on the bar and from there I would describe it as a backwards 
around the world where you rotate arounmd tar but your hips 
dont leave the bar and you have to keep your chin tucked at all
times so you make it all the way around the bar. for floor my 
favirote thing to do would have to be turns. turns can be 
tricky and you have to have very good palance but when you
get the hang of it is truly the best feeling. There are so many
kinds of turns for example thers is a turn called a wolf turn.
for a wolf turn you are in a squatting position with one leg 
extended then you rotate like a turn on your supporting 
leg there also more simple turns like a full turn or a half turn 
whe you just prepm with your hads in front and then procced 
to rotate whether its half a turn or a full turn where your 
none dominate leg is pointed and bent to your knee or ankle.
asnother really fun part of floor is passes. Passes are a 
sequence with 2 or more acrobatic skills like a back flip 
or a round off back handspring back tuck or even a full depending '
on your skill level. you perform passes along the diagonol
of the floor and the end goal ia to make it all the way across 
the floor with some sort of tubling. one of my biggest idols would 
have to be Simone Biles. she is the most decorated gymnast in 
history with 11 olypic metals and 30 world championship metals. 
she has boundless energy as well as natural strenghth and 
ferce determination. not only is she an amazing gymnast but she 
also a powerful voice for mental health awarness and social justice
one thing i find that i can relate to about is that we both 
started at a very young age she is now 28 years old but she 
started at the age of 6 and i have been doing gymnastics since 
i was 3 yearts old now im 15 and i havent ever want to take 
a break or quit gymnastics. 
                    
<div class="idontknow frame">
bruh i am done with this class i eanna go be with my bestfriend in heath class 
because i miss my health class so much and mr. Bainter is my bestfriend like he is 
so nice and i miss getting to see him every morning plus to be honest web desighn is 
notmy thing i mean sure i dont do much but mostly because i just cant focus sometimes 
i find that my mind is just racing and i just cant lock in but anyway the teacher 
is making me write this even though i truly dont know what to write about but if it 
will help my grade then im okay with it right now im so bored and just wanna be with 
mu boyfriend because i miss hi8m so much we are hanging out tis weekend but i am gonna
try to go to his baseball game tommorow but the sad thing is he hasnt gotten to play 
these last few gamesa amyways its been a few days since i have updated this but i am
bacxk but ya i have been so tired but atleast itsa not as bad as yesterday because yesterday 
i was so cranky and mad at everyone for no reason i lowkey dont want to write as much as 
last time but i want to have a good grade this semester i am so confused as well 
because when i was in 8th grade i dont recall sighning up for web desighn and to be honest 
ity is so boring with my vision and everything because i feel so behind and just lost 
but it is fun to argue with mr reiber when he thinks he can be sassier than me '
whcih by the wayt he is not li9ke in the slightest dude i wish i was still in middle 
school because highschool is so boring and overwheleming but yesterday I wemt out 
for ice cream with my aunt because it was a late birthday celebration she takes me out 
every year for my birthday and yesterday we went to menchies whcih is a fro yo place 
that i live right by and out of nowhere i saw some of my old middle school friends
who i miss so much one of them her name is audrey and we did cheer together where she 
was my flyer if you dont know what that is its the person who is up in the air when 
doing a stunt and the bases hold the flyer i was audreys base and we loved working 
together another thing i remeber about doing cheer is at our end of the season party
all the 8th graders got to sighn the cheer mats and leave a special message 
i am really glad i did cheer but i am sad that this year they arent doing cheer 
anymore i had been doing cheer for 3 years and this year would have been my 4th year 
but at the beginning of the season i tore my acl and was out as i am still recovering 
and doing physcial therqpy i am not joining this next year as well which sucks but it is 
better for a faster recovery and with me being as competive as i am its just
for the better in genral because the last thing i want right now is to get re injuried 
and not be back at gymnastics and doing stuff i love so as much as this long break 
is killing me it is better for me and my health so yea but to be honest riught now
i have no clue what to write about anymore because i have talked about everything on my 
mind oh i dont know that this counts as a thought but i am so cold and i wish i brought more 
layers because its suppose to rain and im shivering but i will survive also tonight will be my
first night back at gymnastics in awhile because i have had alot of pain in throwing skills so 
its gonna feel super weird but i really wanna gain my skills back and be back to competing 
soon as possibkle because for me gymnastics is my passion and when i am doing gymnastics
everything goes away and my head is clear of thoughts because all i am worried about is 
doing my best and pushing through the time i have to be there and getting stronger
because with me not being there i have been losing alot of my strength and 
flexiblity which i really want back bvecause for gym i need my core to be strong and firm 
and my flexiblityu to be good and strong.   </div>
<div class="">
 hey guys im back and writing again today in web desighn we are doing this like 
graph racing thing which sounds super fun but i dont understand it and i cant see it 
anyway i hope i get some ice cream cause right now that soounds so good right now but 
what are the flavors like we havent been told anything about it yet just to do it guys 
also i am so sad because we dont have block days for the next 2 weeks and for thursdays
i dont mind but for wensdays we get out at like 1 and now we get out at normal time with
all of our classes in one day which we do everyday but still you know what i mean 
i have never had that kinda schedule before but its to make up snow days and so we 
dont have to go to school so late into the summer also i am excited for spanish today
because uesterday we had a test in that class and i think i did so good which was 
amazing but in other thoughts we are listen to the teacher music right now and let me tell
you it is so bad and the piture or the video for the song is so beyond goofy like i had 
no clue my teacher listen to rock but honestly what was i expecting by the way i have some
exciti9ng new which is io went to gym for the fist time in like 2 months and as much as i 
was so tired after and i felt so unfit it was so worth it and i really tried to lock in 
because i really wanna keep doing gym even with my bad ankle and everything lowkey 
even though it was so hard to get out of bed today now that i am in class i feel more awake 
but bro i am so pissed because today i was having some water from my bestfreinbdf and i 
acciedently choked on it but then my othgetr friend thought it was a good idea to just
hit me which i mean if i was like dying then sure but it wasnt like that it was like 
nothingb and the way wshe hit me like hurt so bad which pissed me off because like what 
the hell but anyway i dont know i dont evem think i weanna be friends with her because 
recently she thinks she is like in control of me or something and can like be the boss of me 
and when i even say one thing she will like hit me and be like dont say that even 
though i didnt say anything and also other thing she does is when my dad drives me here i 
tend to get here early and then she gets there later and we have this spot we meet up at 
and i sit on the floor because its comfy and i dont want to be standing for like 30 minutes 
but as soon as she gets there she iws like thats so gross dont do that like i could never 
and she also says like why do you never com3e omn the bus and why are you always leaving me even 
even thoughi am on the bus more than half the time and she is nver there when i am so like 
does that mean i get to be mad at her because like what the hell but i dont know to be 
honest i am just pissed with her choices andf stuff when she is the one who thinks she is 
all big and in charge oh and heres the other thing okay so bascially i have this really 
close friend names ashlyn and we have know each other since we were 11 and since the start 
of 6th grade where as i have know this girl addy since like 8th grade so like alittle over 
a year but nothing crazy and ashlyn and addy used to be freinds but she started being 
rude to ashlyn and saying alot of stuff about ashlyn and her boyfriend like he is a red 
flag even though she dont even know her boyfriend for nothing at all and so then ashlyn 
decided she didnt want to be friends so they were liken just talking when they needed to 
and then addy was like can we be friends again and ashlyn was like sure even though
she didnt want to be but then addy came to me and was like donty tell ashlyn and then 
started talkiung alot of crap about her and again me and ashlyn have been freinds forver so 
of courser i told her and then addy found out but somehow was only mad at ashlyn even she
did absoilutley nothing at all i was the one who told her but anyway so then addy said to 
ashlyn i dont wanna be friends anymore and ashlyn was like okay cool and addy ever 
since has been talking about ashlyn to me and i have been telling her everuything 
she has been saying about her because i am more close with ashlyn then i ever will be 
with addy and i am glad of it because i really dont weanna be friends with asddy
 anymore but i am a people pleaser so i dont know how to tell her because i dont wanna be rude ]
 or hurt her feelings but with everything she has done to me this would be litterly nothing 
 for me to do to her like you dont undertand and she keeps asking me like why are you 
 friends with ashlyn and i am like because i love her and i trust her so much and
 i have know her way longer plus she is much kinder and actully cares about me and 
 my feelings and also she hass been there for me through thick and thin even when we had 
 been drifting apart but now we are back to being really tight and i am so happy 
 because she means the woirld to me okay but moving on because i have been writing alot 
 this and yes i know it is good to vent but sttil i feel like if i stay on one topic for 
 too long i get lost and ramble about litterly anything that comesn to the top of my mind 
 also i took a quick water breask just a second ago just to let you know even though 
 like nobody caeres and or is reading this although in other news yesterday at lunch me 
 and my bestfreind cc went to our normal spot where we sit for lunch and we were on
 our phones just chilling when these 2 guys who i think were juniors or seniors 
 came and sat on the staircase right below us and started talking to us 
 they said they were brothers and they were athletes but i believe niether of those things 
</div>
<div>Your favorite person is it back once again it is currently thursday may 1st at 8:23 am
  which means its the first of the month that is crazy to think about because it reminds me 
how fast this school year is flying by yesterday felt like i was starting 6th grade where 
as now we are more than half way through freshman year and in less then 2 months i will 
be considered a sophmore meaning there will only be 3 more years till i graduate when 
i was in 8th grade people told me freshman year will fly by but i never believed them 
but now i am here and in shock of how fast things have flown i mean used to be this 
little kid who wanted to go to the park and now i spend more time at school then 
i do at any park things go in the blink of an eye and i used to always want to
grow up but as i have just turned 15 i never wanna get older i mean sure there is 
so much to learn and so many amazing thngs to come but i am truly in my prime years 
right now but anywayyyy i have so much to update you guys on for example me 
and my now ex boyfriend decided we just want to be frienbds because he needs 
to focuse on baseball and i think that is totally okay and we are still really 
close which i am so thankful for but as of a few days ago me and my bestfriend 
have been talking to these guys who are freinds and since we are bestfriends it can be 
a double date sort of thhing which is so exciting and now we are meeting up on saturday 
all together which i am so excited for and the guys are so sweet so it will be really nice 
at first this guy added me on snap and was like your cute asnd i was curious if you 
would wannas hangout with me and my friend and he said i could bring a friend for his 
frtiend so i asked for a pic of his friend for my bestfreind and then when he sent
 it i thought his friend was cute and my bestfriend liked the guy who added me so i 
asked for his friends snap and i gave my bestfriend the guy who added me's snap amd then 
we all created a group chat and at first my bestfriend was kind of unsre and
 worried but then she started to like him so we are all gonna hangout and its also nice 
 because we all are christian and go to church so we could go to church all together
  sometime you feel me which would be so cute and the other thing is me and my guy have been
snappijng alot and texting whichg hgas been really nice because he so sweet but we are 
takinmg things slow which i like alot because i have never really had that before so its 
nice to keep things calm in other news though yesterday my dad came and got me from school 
early because i was having a hard day so he came and got me and we went to starbucks at
starbucks i got a grande pink drink with light ice and vanillia cold foam and for food i got 
a crosant and a like box thing with cheese grapes crackers and apples in it the cool thing 
about it was there was 3 diffrent types of cheese and i only ate one of them but i have had
 all of them atleast once before anyway though i have to get some water so i will be right 
back hold on okay im back and it was really fast but ya it is currently 8:54 am and we 
get out of this class at 9:05 am which then means i have to go to spanish which i mean is fine 
but i dont wanna you feel me but whatever its not the worst so we chilling also giuys not that 
abnyone cares but it is so cold and that might be because i am wearing shorts and a t shirt but
i am not sure but i only wore what i did because it is supposed to be in the 70s today which 
is warm for bothell so we have to take advantage of it when the weather is like this guys though i forgot 
it was thursday and thurday is when i do my chores so hopefully i can get them done today
because i have been forgetting recently which is bad because when i do my chores i get paid
but ya lowkey do not know what to write about right now because i have shared everythihng 
on my mind no but for real i am so excited for my 6th period today because i miss the 
student i work with her name is bailey and she is so beyond sweet she is a junior but 
sometimes she needs some extra help so i am always here for her guys i am listening 
to the most deppressing song right now but it is also good and i have heard it 
all over tiktok so its okay but guys i have tutorinbg today for 2 hours which is just so fun 
but who cares      </div>

lowkey im so tired but also its a mondays so its okay but who cares like im trying and for no 
reason im being like idk im not even gonna start but i am not sure how to feek because i 
wasnt even laughing i opened my computer and now im just so done but man i just dont know 
sorry guys it was a hard day ysterday but i am feeling better and more awake you feel me 
this is my last long paragraph that i have to do i think which i am happy about and i am 
also excited because today is nacho day at school but guess what my bestfriend is not feeling 
well so she aint here today but i hate because i miss her but as of yesterday we had a 
four day sleepover and as long as it was it was also so beyond fun and a nice feeling but i 
am not gonna lie getting to sleep in my own bed last night was an amazing feeling and 
i got to take aq shower which was refreshing but todasy i have gymnastics after school and 
then ya i have homework to do and i am pissed because i need to get stuff done but i dont 
have time to turn everythiung in so i have to lock in during lunch and its helpful because 
my bestfreind isnt here so i can work in silentness but i knwo for a fact that by lunch i will 
be hungry so i will need to eat it was vrazy because i got here really early this morning 
and it was nice to sit alone and eat my food and drink my drink from starbucks in peace 
im fully aware how rude that sounded but sometumes for me just being left alone is 
the best so i dont lose my temoper with anyone and the reason for this and me saying this is 
because sometimes when i dont get the space i need i get overstimulated which results in me 
flipping out for no reason because of my nerves and anxiety guys i just took a second to 
listen to the teacher and i looked at the board and when i say it was scary i mean 
i was like svared but its okay because its just a coding thing he is doing with the class while 
i sit here and write this whole thing for his class because i am not able to do the stuff
he is doing which can be hard but its okay becaused i like just writing what comnes to my
head down and it can be funny to look back at it and be like um what was i thinking in 
that moment its supposed to be over 77 degrees today but only a uv of 6 which is confusing but 
hopefully it goes up but its not like i can tan because i ahev gym and stuff but whatever the 
warm is nice anyway okay but pause can we just take a second for the teachers shirt today
because i dont know something about it is so cute to me but its also so uneven and ugly but
i think it matches him which is cute he just made us repeat something after him and when we did it 
sounded like robots if you know what i mean oooo but i have a thing to say so bascially 
yesterday in english we had a sub and we have had this sub before and she is so chill so 
yesterday we had a whole free period which was so funa nd then the assiant teacher let me 
leave early to go get a snack from my old english teacher and leyt me tell you it was yummy 
but hopefully we have a sub again and i hope if we do its her bvecause she my fav but 
moiving on from that me and my talking stage are doing really good and we really want to
hangout again plus we have bneen talking and snapping everyday and i really want to tell my dad
about him and i talking so i am going to after gym tonight you feel me because ya but the last 
time we hung out as soon as he got to my hosue my dad and him shook hands and it made me so happy 
because i really like this kid and i want hima nd my dad to get along well and i think my dad 
is happy for me because this morning in the car my dad brought him up and asked me if 
i liked him and i said yes because this kid is so sweet and i do really like him so ya 
but tommorow i have the first part of my history test s o hopefully i vdo well but i am not 
completly sure yet but i got this like confidence is key so yaa but i also have a bio test 
coming up and i think i can do good on that and today in bio we are just having a full period 
of review on our packets for practice but ya also hol;d on i willk be right back okay 
i am finally back i had to run to the retsroom and then put lotion on my hands but ya 
i probably didnt need to share that okauy but so yesterday i went to my old middle 
school for my bestfreinds little sisters volleyball game and they were close to winning 
but still lost sadly but being back at my old middle school felt so weird i was able to see 
the old cheer mats and saw the football feild and me and my bestfriend walked around
 and it was nice but brought back so many memories and we even got to go in the
  girls locker room and last year when i went there i was shorter then the lockers 
  like i couldnt even see over them and now i am like towering over it or like not really i
  like i am just alittle taller but still its just crazy how much i have changed and grown
  recently and just since i have been in highschool and like freshamn year has gone by in the blink of 
  any eye and in exacly a month i will be considered a sophmore like no thanks and i mean 
  i will always choose being in hgihschool then being in middle school but like some of me
